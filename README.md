# Building a Transpiler from scratch

This is a repository for the [Building a Transpiler from scratch](http://dmitrysoshnikov.com/courses/transpiler-from-scratch/) course.

As mentioned in the class description, we want our students to understand and implement every piece of detail from the Transpiler themselves, instead of copy-pasting from the final solution.

Therefore, the source code here provides only the overall structure of the project, leaving the missing parts as assignments. The _"Implement here..."_ comments with references to appropriate video lectures, show specific places which are needed to be completed in order to finalize the full working interpreter.

Example:

```javascript
if (exp[0] === "var") {
  // Implement here...
}
```
